# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Since this being setup as SvelteKit project, so you should create your component in `src/lib` directory.
And re-export it in `src/lib/index.js` file.
```javascript
export { default as MyComponent } from './MyComponent.svelte';
```

## Publish Package
Simply run this
```bash
svelte-package
```
will create a new directory called `package` with the TypeScript definition
<br>

Then you can publish it to npm
```bash
cd package
npm publish
```
